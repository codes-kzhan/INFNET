Multi-Label Classification with INFNET

You can get the data by executing the following command:

wget http://www.cics.umass.edu/~belanger/icml_mlc_data.tar.gz


Kalpesh Krishna has implemented a Tensorflow version of the this project!

Here are some mistakes that you maybe make (Thanks for Kalpesh's feedback)   

1. Not having a classification threshold and assuming it to be 0.5.

2. Not pre-training b_i jointly with F(x) in the first stage, and misunderstanding the scheme used to load the initial A(x) parameters.

3. Calculating sum(hinge_loss_objective) rather than mean(hinge_loss_objective).

4. Calculating label averaged F-1 scores rather than example averaged F-1 scores
